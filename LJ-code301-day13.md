# Code 301 Learning Journal Week 3 - Day 13
It was nice to see everything come together and get deployed yesterday.  I'm really looking forward to the final project to see how we can make everything from scratch in a week.  It'll be a good challenge considering all the labs so far have been about adding bits of code rather than writing it from the start.
