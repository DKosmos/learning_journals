# Code 301 Learning Journal Week 2 - Day 10
It's too bad that functional programming was essentially tagged onto the end of the week when we'd usually do review on Friday.  It seems like a very important concept to get down, but I'm concerned that we're just gonna move on without practicing it more.  Overall, I think heavy/important subjects should be tackled on Tues/Wed rather than Friday.
