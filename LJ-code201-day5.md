# Learning Journal 3 - Day 5
## The end of the first week!
I'm feeling quite good about things finishing up the first week.  None of the Javascript coding has really be difficult for me, though I know that's going to change.  The hardest part so far has been CSS and how to design the webpage.  I feel like I'm starting to understand Git better, and I'm more comfortable with the terminal.  Overall, I'm looking forward to the rest of the course!
