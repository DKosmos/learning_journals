# Learning Journal - Day 3
I struggled a bit more with Question 6 than I thought I would.  I don't know if it's brain fart that never cleared or what, but I'll have a second look at it tomorrow.  I think I improved the html structure significantly, but I still don't know how to make it look professional through CSS.  I played around with the float, position, size, etc but the design is still very plain.

##Morning Update
I woke up this morning and fixed question 6. I think I got hung up on whether the do-while was going to continue if the condition is true vs. false, so I just needed a clear head. I also experimented with the innerHTML method to learn how to write into HTML with JS, and created a separate page to write the answers to the guessing game which is now activated by a button.
