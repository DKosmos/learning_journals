# Code 301 Learning Journal Week 1 - Day 5
I'm glad the weeks will be ending with a workshop rather than a lecture and pair programming.  That makes each week must more manageable knowing that Friday is going to be an early day.  Not having any coding problems or learning problems after the 'View' week.  Onto the 'Model'!
