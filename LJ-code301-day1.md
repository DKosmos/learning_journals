# Code 301 Learning Journal Week 1 - Day 1
I'm a little concerned about this month simply because of how the lecture/lab timing is switched around.  I'm a morning person and know I'm most focused before noon, then I'm relatively creative in the afternoon, until I start to lose energy around 3-4pm.  This worked perfectly in Code 201 because lecture was in the morning, lab was in the afternoon, and I often finished before I started fading.  Code 301 going to challenge my daily energy levels because during lecture I will potentially be unfocused but curious, and during pair programming from 4-6pm I'll potentially be tired, grumpy and hungry (which isn't good for pair programming for obvious reasons).  So hopefully I'll manage so that non-programming stuff doesn't get in the way of learning programming.
